🔧 1. Tech Stack Overview
Frontend (Mobile App)

Framework: React Native (cross-platform iOS/Android)

Libraries: expo-camera, react-native-image-picker, axios

Backend (API + AI Integration)

Framework: FastAPI (Python)

Image Processing: OpenCV, Pillow

AI Model: Custom fine-tuned CLIP or Google Vision API / AWS Rekognition

Data: Wine databases (Vivino, Wine-Searcher, LCBO, Wine.com via scraping/API)

Database

PostgreSQL or MongoDB for wine metadata, user logs, reviews

Optional AI Enhancements

OCR: Tesseract for extracting text

GPT for generating tasting notes and food pairings based on wine description

📲 2. App Features
🏷️ Label Scan
Use camera or upload image

Detect and crop wine label

Match against known wines using image embedding + nearest-neighbor search

📄 Wine Details
Name, region, grape variety

Vintage

Alcohol content

Average rating and user reviews

Tasting notes

Suggested food pairings

Price and availability

📝 User Interaction
Add to “My Cellar”

Rate & review wines

🏗️ 3. Project Setup – Phase 1 Scaffolding
Backend (FastAPI)
bash
Copy
Edit
fastapi
uvicorn
pillow
opencv-python
tqdm
transformers
scikit-learn
python
Copy
Edit

🔮 Future Expansion Ideas:
- AR wine label overlay (scan label → get live overlay info)

- Barcode/QR support for commercial wines

- Voice assistant to describe the wine

- Wine & food pairing wizard

- Social feed for wine lovers


🧠 Backend (FastAPI)

python
Copy
Edit
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from PIL import Image
import io

app = FastAPI()

# Enable CORS for mobile development

To run it locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install fastapi uvicorn pillow
uvicorn main:app --reload
🚀 Deployment
You can deploy the backend using:

Render (free tier)

Railway.app

Vercel (via Serverless Function)

🔮 Next Steps - gen AI Model
To improve:

Integrate Google Vision API or CLIP for label embedding

Use FAISS for nearest-neighbor image search

Store wine metadata in PostgreSQL or MongoDB

Future pushes:

- Help in integrating a real wine database (e.g., Vivino)?

- Dockerfile or GitHub Actions for CI/CD?
